### About
Developed a Pomodoro timer app that tracks work sessions and displays daily productivity on a calendar.

### How to use
1. Set a timer by typing how many minutes you want to set or clicking up or down spinner buttons (step is 5 and max is 60).

2. When the timer runs out, it notices you by an alarm sound. ðŸ””

3. The work session time is added to the day's total, allowing you to see the total hours and minutes you've completed in a day directly on the calendar.	ðŸ“…
  
4. The reset button resets the timer back to its initial state.

### Update
I noticed that the timer is sometimes not working on the background, especially SetIntervel() does not work on the background.  
I use Web Worker API to fix this issue.
