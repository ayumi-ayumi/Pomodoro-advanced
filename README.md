### About
This is an useful timer for someone who wants to know how much you study or work in a day.

### How to use
1. Set a timer by typing how many minutes you want to set or clicking up and down spinner buttons (step is 5 and max is 60).

2. When the timer runs out, it notices you by an alarm sound. :bell:

3. The run up time duration will be added to the today's total and you can see how many hours/minutes you have done in a day on the calendar. :date:
  
4. The reset button makes the timer set again.

### Update
I noticed that the timer is sometimes not working on the background, especially SetIntervel() does not work on the background. 
I use Web Worker API to fix this issue.
